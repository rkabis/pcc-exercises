    "One hundred people are lined up with their boarding passes showing their seats on the 100-seat Plane. The first guy in line drops his pass as he enters the plane, and unable to pick it up with others behind him sits in a random seat. The people behind him, who have their passes, sit in their seats until one of them comes upon someone sitting in his seat, and takes his seat in a new randomly chosen seat. This process continues until there is only one seat left for the last person. What is the probability that the last person will find his seat unoccupied?"
